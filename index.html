  <head> <!-- head is the part that holds info about the webpage, and tells the browser how it should handle the page. There are numerous tags in this part, such as <title>. Head contains information mainly for machine processing, not human readability. More info here: https://devdocs.io/html/element/head -->
    <meta charset="utf-8"> <!-- meta elements give extra metadata (associated data) to the html document. Search engines crawl the website's html looking for certain meta tags to get info on what the site is about + how to display it in search engine. There are several meta elements. charset sets the character encoding of the page, in this case UTF-8 which is recommended as it works for most browsers.
